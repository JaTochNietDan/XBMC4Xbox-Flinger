## XBMC4Xbox Flinger
I'm a big fan of XBMC and a long time user of XBMC4Xbox. Unfortunately due to the official XBMC moving on to bigger and better places, XBMC4Xbox is losing compatbility with a lot of the plugins/applications that are being created for use with XBMC. One of these is the functionality of being able to send YouTube videos from your Android device to your XBMC4Xbox device. So therefore I have created this super simple application to fill that gap, it took a couple of hours to get together as it was my first Android application and I had a bit of learning to do, but I've tested it a bit and it seems to be working well. So why keep it to myself when it is fully configurable and useable by anyone else? For that reason I've released it here for the time being. 

### Instructions

- Download the APK from [releases](https://github.com/JaTochNietDan/XBMC4Xbox-Flinger/releases/tag/1.0)
- Get the APK onto your Android device, through USB or other methods
- Run the APK by browsing to it on your device using a file browsing application, like ES File Explorer
- Open XBMC4Xbox Flinger
- Fill in your XBMC4Xbox's web server details and hit save

**Note: You will need to enable the installation of APK's from unknown sources to allow it to install, you can do this by going to Settings -> Applications and toggling Unknown Sources.**
